#### 5.1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overview

The basic structure of the original M+R script has been maintained. For each function, the primary macro, `cabinair_frame`:
* Evaluates whether a function is "active", i.e., if preconditions hold for it to bring about change to system state.
* Calculates, if the above evaluation has succeeded, the function's delta (change or rate of change).
* Determines, for sound-emitting functions, the sound volume.

Lastly it computes the final values that (measurable) system state comprises, off of their initial values and corresponding deltas. For example, in the case of cabin temperature, the overall difference from the cabin temperature the frame before is the summation of the temperature rates of all functions that affect temperature.

#### 5.2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Integration adapter

As already noted in the [integration section](./2_installation_integration.md#2221authoring-the-integration-adapter), `uchill.osc` depends on an intermediate adapter script in order to retrieve and update vehicle-specific information / state in a portable fashion. The sequence-like diagram below depicts the interaction between the two scripts:
![main_script_adapter_script_interaction](http://i.imgur.com/WFOc5g2.png)
In plain English, the interaction comprises the following steps:

1. During initialization, after the main script of the vehicle has delegated to the `uchill_init` macro:
    1. `uchill_init` delegates to `uchill_integration__init`, which performs the initialization logic (if any) needed by the adapter script.
    1. `uchill_init` delegates to `uchill_integration__acquire_static_vehicle_attributes`, which assigns values of vehicle-specific variables and/or constants, representing *static* vehicle attributes (e.g., the vehicle's cabin's air volume capacity), to their corresponding integration variables.
    1. `uchill_init` delegates to `uchill_integration__acquire_dynamic_vehicle_attributes`, which assigns values of vehicle-specific variables, representing *dynamic* vehicle attributes (e.g., whether a roof-mounted A/C unit is present, in the case of a vehicle allowing in-game (de-)installation of the unit), to their corresponding integration variables.
1. During each frame, after the main script of the vehicle has delegated to the `uchill_frame` macro, and *before* `uchill_frame` delegates to `cabinair_frame` (wherein UCHill's core logic lies):
    1. `uchill_frame` delegates to `uchill_integration__acquire_dynamic_vehicle_attributes` (see above).
    1. `uchill_frame` delegates to `uchill_integration__acquire_vehicle_state`, which assigns values of vehicle-specific variables, representing actual vehicle *state* (e.g. whether the engine is running), to the corresponding integration variables.
1. Finally, during each frame, after the main script of the vehicle has delegated to the `uchill_frame` macro, and *after* `cabinair_frame` has returned:
    * `uchill_frame` delegates to `uchill_integration__actualize_vehicle_state`, which, unlike the previous macros, is responsible for assigning the values of integration variables set by `uchill.osc` *itself* (e.g., state of a controller's indicator), to corresponding vehicle-specific variables.

In summary:
* `uchill_integration__init` initializes the adapter.
* `uchill_integration__actualize_vehicle_state` *pushes* information from `uchill.osc` to the rest of the vehicle.
* The remaining of the integration macros *pull* information from the vehicle to `uchill.osc`.

Of course, in cases where the information provided by the vehicle does not fully adhere to the format or semantics `uchill.osc` expects it to, or the other way around, it is the job of the integration adapter's macros to convert between the two. It is also their job to declare any other variables that the remainder of the vehicle's infrastructure expects to be provided by the cooling / heating script, and set their values.

#### 5.3&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Variables

#### 5.3.1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Local

The following are the variables declared and employed by `uchill.osc`. Note that solely variables that might be of some value to third-party scripts are enumerated in this section—those internal to the script, i.e., those being of "technical" nature and/or having no stable contract or strict value set, are disregarded. Also keep in mind that, unless otherwise specified, reassigning any variable(s) externally will likely cause `uchill.osc` to break, unless you know what you are doing.

As it currently stands, due to the amount of work that it would require, as well as the likelihood of the resulting document becoming impossible to maintain as a result, variable relationships are currently not given herein. The inline commentary of `uchill.osc` might provide some further insight; if not, feel free to ask along.

#### 5.4.1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Local

The following is a non-exhaustive list of constants appearing within `uchill.osc`, some of which may *not* be fit for customization. Note that the script does not perform any sanitization of constant values whatsoever; also, constants' names might be misleading. Therefore, before modifying a constant's value, consider taking a (figurative) moment to study the implementation's use of that constant—what it actually represents, which values, value range(s), or other constraints it is expected to adhere to, and how it affects dependent variables.

#### 5.5&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Macros

The next table provides a summary over some key macros amongst those of `uchill.osc`, (a subset of) which, along with the macros they delegate to, you will most likely have to refer to, when looking for answers to questions not addressed by the documentation, or adapt, in (the not at all unlikely) case the script does not, nor can be adequately customized via its constants so as to, satisfy your particular use case.

Macro | Purpose
------|--------
`cabinair_frame` | This macro, being a remnant of the original M+R script, contains most of the script's core logic. Its concerns, some implemented by the macros it delegates to, others inline, include a) function state adjustment, b) calculation of pertinent output temperatures, air / humidity volumes, emitted sound volumes, and heat / temperature rates, c) calculation and update of overall cabin temperature / humidity, and d) calculation of the degree of window misting. Due to being so conspicuously ad-hoc, the macro is a candidate for further modularization / refactoring in the future.
`calculate_driver_ac_temps`<br/>`calculate_passenger_ac_temps`<br/>`calculate_cabin_heater_temps`<br/>`ghe_impact` | Calculation of output temperature (or temperature rate, in the case of `ghe_impact`).
`actualize_driver_ac_status`<br/>`actualize_passenger_ac_status`<br/>`actualize_auto_humidity_management_status`<br/>`actualize_ac_humidity_management_status`<br/>`actualize_auxheat_status`<br/>`actualize_cabin_heater_status` | Determination of function state.
`calculate_driver_ac_air_exchange_volumes`<br/>`calculate_passenger_ac_air_exchange_volumes`<br/>`calculate_cabin_heater_air_exchange_volume` | Calculation of output air / humidity volume.
`actualize_driver_ac_sound`<br/>`actualize_passenger_ac_sound`<br/>`actualize_ext_ac_sound`<br/>`actualize_auxheat_sound`<br/>`actualize_cabin_heater_sound` | Adjustment of sound volume.
`calculate_window_int_misting_degree`<br/>`calculate_window_ext_misting_degree` | Adjustment of window misting.
